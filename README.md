Description of the project: 
Our project consists of a web driven database for board games searches. Users can search and find boardgames and their attributes, including description and thumbnail, etc. 

This repo contains starter code for the database-driven web project. It consists of the following files:

createtable.sql: A Python script used to create a database and set up the table(s), including table columns and types.

earthquakeData.csv: A comma-space delimited text file containing earthquake data from the end of August through the end of September, 2017. Use this to practice setting up your database if you haven't yet identified a dataset.

psycopg-2.py: A Python script that executes SQL queries using the psycopg2 library.
