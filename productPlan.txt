Project Plan

The data that we plan to use is a list of boardgames that includes number of players,
publisher, year published, a description of the game, possible expansions, average game
length, and mechanics in the game. We found this data set is included in the R package,
bgg Analysis. https://github.com/9thcirclegames/bgg-analysis . On the license file it says
"Permission is herby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this 
software and associated documentation file...".

The intended audience for this dataset is users who want to learn about new boardgames, as
well as people who want to learn about existing boardgames. Users can also search through
particular genres and attributes if they have a preference or they are looking for recommendations that follow the same idea as their search.

Key functional requirements:
1. The system must take user input and display appropriate results.
    i. The system shall present the results an organized hierarchical way.
    ii. The system shall provide additional recommendations for each correct search.
2. If there are no results that match the user input, the system must return links to other database (Google etc.)
3. The system must provide a list of "popular" games on the home page.
    i. The system shall have a view of boardgames on the homepage.
4. The system must update the data base from time to time.
